# st2195_assignment_8

Here is the tasks:

1. assignment_8_1.ipynb to replicate assignment 7 in Python.

2. assignment_8_2.ipynb to describe the latest bilateral trade data for the G7 (this aggregate can be computed using bilateral imports and exports data available on the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics) with the three network graphical representations in the module on network visualisation.

3. assignment_8_3.ipynb to repeat the second bullet point using one year ago data and compare the output with the latest results using a 3x2 subplot containing all the network representations.

Note 1: Upload the data used for the second and third bullet points in csv format in your repository.

Note 2: Describe in the README.md file the measure used for aggregating bilateral imports and exports. Be careful with the definition of the data downloaded from the IMF DTS. 

-> In my case, I simply used 'Exports of goods, Free on board (FOB), US dollar' data in 'INDICATOR' field.
